              I specialize in building innovative and scalable applications using a diverse set of technologies, including <b>React, Java, Python, Angular, SQL, and PostgreSQL.</b> My projects span across multiple domains, showcasing expertise in both frontend and backend development.
            </p>
            <p>
              Notable work includes developing a comprehensive e-commerce platform, a B2B application, an AI-powered chatbot integration, data visualization dashboards, and social media analytics tools. Leveraging React and Angular for seamless and responsive user interfaces, combined with robust backend services built in Java, Node.js, and Python, I deliver solutions that are both efficient and scalable.
            </p>
            <p>
              I also bring strong database management experience, working extensively with SQL and PostgreSQL to design and optimize schemas, queries, and transaction handling. These projects demonstrate my ability to create full-stack web applications with features such as user authentication, role-based access control, product catalog management, AI integration, and real-time data visualization.
